# EDA Notebook Details

The EDA notebook contains some preliminary analysis that we conducted on our data from Boston Public Library's database.

We analyzed metadata retreived from the Digital CommonWealth API as well as full-text data, also retreived from the API.

Some of our findings, including how much of the image/video data has text annotations, will help in determing how we should conduct RAG in the coming phase.

Please make sure your environment is the same as our to run the notebook using the following commands:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Also make sure to access the data, stored in the SCC in /projectnb/sparkgrp/ml-bpl-rag-data/

Full text can be found in /projectnb/sparkgrp/ml-bpl-rag-data/text
