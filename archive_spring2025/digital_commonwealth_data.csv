Dr. James Naismith, the creator of Basketball, was an early SC Gymnast. Leslie Judd, widely considered a father of modern Gymnastics, was head coach for many years. In 1955, Frank Wolcott began coaching the men’s gymnastics team at Springfield College. Bob Cargill followed up Wolcott and coached the team for 1 season from 1981-1982. The team was then coached by Steve Posner, who remains as the head coach today. He has coached the team for 30 seasons and has an overall record of 137 wins and 206 losses. During the 1990-1991 season, Eric Weiskopf took over as head coach and Posner returned during the 1991-1992 season."", ""Scale is not 1:1 because item was digitized using a Canon EOS Rebel T1i.

Some of America&#39;s finest artists, graphic designers, magazine illustrators, advertising agents, and commercial artists contributed to their designs. They were called upon to design for a variety of causes, including recruitment, conservation, solicitation of donations for relief groups, war propaganda, and the various loan campaigns.<br/><br/>The posters were meant to have widespread appeal and were often colorful, with simple legible messages. The majority of the designs followed themes of patriotism and unity. Patriotic symbols such as the Statue of Liberty, the American Flag, Uncle Sam, the Liberty Bell, and easily recognizable government buildings were often depicted in the posters. Posters were displayed in libraries, schools, town halls, factories, churches, and bus and train stations. Merchants, restaurant owners, and grocers were also encouraged to exhibit them.<br/><br/>The widespread distribution and display of these posters kept the American public apprised of the country&#39;s war needs. They were a visual call to arms for all citizens.<br/><br/>This is a sampling of American War Posters from the Boston Public Library Print Department&#39;s collection of more than 500 such posters.",,,,,,War Posters,,,,,,,,,,,

Series presented by the Watertown Living History Project. Funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities. Hester Street tells the story of Jewish immigrants who come to the Lower East side of New York City in 1896 from Europe and who live on Hester Street in Manhattan. The film is noteworthy for its detailed reconstruction of Jewish immigrant life in New York at the turn of the century?much of the dialogue is delivered in Yiddish with English subtitles?and was part of the wave of films released in the late 1960s and through the 1970s which began explicitly to deal with the complexities of American Jewish identity. In addition, the lead character posed a still-provocative synthesis as she discovers her own self-assertion on behalf of her right to maintain a traditional identity in an aggressively modern setting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They were run by the City Mission and taught by volunteers. By 1869, there were 300 pupils from 9 nations. In 1870, the Lawrence School committee took over responsibility for running the Evening School. At that time, a school for women and girls was housed in Oliver School and for men and boys in City Hall. Course work included reading and writing and architectural drawing. 1887 saw the enactment of a state law regarding the employment of minors over the age of 14 who could not read and write in the English language. Consequently, the size of the Evening School increased by 400 pupils to a total of 625. The students were being taught at schools all over the city.<br/><br/>In 1919, as the result of 400,000 draftees being unable to read in any language, Massachusetts enacted the Americanization Act. This law (Chapter 295) was created &ldquo;to promote Americanization through the education of adult persons unable to use the English language.&rdquo; The state would bear half of the expense of this program as long as the instruction was carried out under the aegis of the local school committee. In Lawrence, of the 35,729 workers, 23,034 were unable to speak English readily; 6,328 could speak English slightly; and 3,790 were not able to speak English at all. How many then could not read English? The Lawrence School Committee formally accepted the provisions of the Americanization Act in October of 1919. The evening school had been teaching English at that time to 64 men in the Oliver School. This new program was instituted as part of the Evening School. The number had increased to 500 by the spring of 1920. By the fall of 1920, 624 adults were being taught in 24 classrooms--14 of the rooms were in public school buildings, and the other 10 were halls, club rooms, and social centers. 16 nationalities were represented in these classes. Citizenship classes were also held: 209 men were instructed and 161 got their papers and, for the first time, 18 women took instruction and 14 were given certificates. Elizabeth Miles was appointed a full-time Americanization worker in May of 1921 under the Supervisor of the Evening School and Adult Immigrant Education. Training was given in Lawrence by the State Department of Education to prepare teachers for this work. From 1923 to 1935 Elizabeth C. Miles was Supervisor of Americanization and had her office in the Oliver School. In 1936, she became the Supervisor of Adult Immigrant Education.<br/><br/>This broadside was printed on stiff paper. It is somewhat dirty and torn. It measure 56 x 35 cm. The printing is in black and there is a black border around the text. The text reads: &ldquo;!!Get ready!! For citizenship. Classes held in the Oliver, Essex &amp; Packard Schools Mon., Wed., &amp; Thurs. 7 to 9. For people who work nights classes are held in the Oliver School room 108 Mon., Tues., &amp; Wed. mornings from 9 to 11. Groups for classes of 12 or more may be formed in your clubs.

What made the leaders of Virginia, a state long known as ""the mother of presidents,"" finally decide to break their ties with the nation?

Office of the Mayor""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"[""English""]",,,,"Recording 2 of 2 of an oral history interview with Florence Luscomb in which she discusses the nature of her involvement in various organized labor movements. Luscomb discusses her tenure as president of a Public Stenographers Union firm and her departure from the position. She remarks that after she realized the firm only sought to maintain their monopoly as the only source of union labor in their field rather than unionize more firms, she moved to the United Office and Professional Workers Union (UOPWU). She comments on the difficulty of uniting office workers into a union and UOPWU. Luscomb remarks on the Garment Labor movement in New York, the Garment Strikes of 1934, the International Lady Garment Workers Union, the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire, and the Joint Board of Sanitary Control by union garment factories in New York (a safety measure to catch slip ups in state inspections). She also comments on the Joint Board of Sanitary Control in Boston, its initial director, Myriam C. Wool[?], and her appointment as Wool’s successor. Luscomb discusses her work as the director/ inspector of the women's union garment factories in Boston, remarking on the inadequate state inspection force for garment workers that left poor conditions and lack of compliance with safety and sanitary conditions. She comments on her methodology to address these issues, which included bringing affluent women to see the conditions in the factories and having them send complaints to the state and to the newspapers in order to elicit a response from the state inspection. She also discusses her degree in architecture from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), her work in that field, and the impact that World War I had on her architecture career. Luscomb remarks on her experiences as a labor activist during the McCarthy era: how she was called up before the state committee and refused to answer any questions, how they accused her of ""things'' in their report, and how she sued them. Other topics mentioned include: the Garment District, Boylston Street, South Station, Don Tormey from the United Electrical Workers (UE), picket lines, United Farm Workers, 9to5, ""runaway firms""[companies that moved to the South to flee unions], Sam Angoph[?] Esq.",60ef28aa-00e6-4e05-85ce-ef0a1a8826ab,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The document was handed down through the family for many generations, and was apparently written by a family member, who heard the stories from a relative who was 8 years old at the time of events. There are detailed descriptions of the events at Deacon Adams House as well as the Jason Russell House. The story was apparently written by a descendant of Phlip C. Whittemore, and donor believes it was written by Abigal Whittemore, 1797-1882, who was the only one living in Arlington. In between the lines of the story of April 19 are two partial letters, written in the same hand on Dec. 25, 1850, in West Cambridge.
